             <p>My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and read in class 7th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.</p>

        <p>Grandma’s Bag of Stories is a beautiful collection of interesting stories to share with kids from the pen of very popular author Mrs. Sudha Murthy. The book will take you through the memory lane of your childhood days spent at your grandparent’s home. Sudha Murty’s Grandma’s Bag of Stories is simply wonderful and full of engaging stories of monkeys and mice, kings and cheats, scorpions and hidden treasures and princesses and onions.
The book starts with the grandmother Ajji waiting for her grandkids Raghu and Meenu to arrive for summer vacations. The other pair of sibling Anand and Krishna had already arrived. The craziness and fondness of the kids for their Ajji is what is narrated in the first chapter of the book. How the kids loved to listen to Ajji’s funny and wonderful stories.

The conversation between Ajji and her grandchildren is interesting and engaging. It lets us dig into the kind of bondings and inspiration grandparents can have on today’s younger generation.

The book takes you on a journey from a real world to the world of fantasies and fiction. The children in the story learn about the village life, farmers, birds, and animals while walking in the paddy fields with their grandfather. On the other hand, they learn about the moral values, culture and different virtues of life from the stories narrated to them by their loving and affectionate grandmother.

After narrating every story the grandmother discusses it with the kids in the first few stories. And this is the part which brings the crux of every story they listened. The visualizations the kids went to and the lessons they learned are all discussed at last which further increases the curiosity of the reader to read all the stories covered in the book.

Though we miss this discussion in the later part of the book, yet the stories keep us excited and interested enough to read.

Ajji’s stories are based on the values of courage, intelligence, foresight, and kindness. There are stories where she tells the significance of listening to others, how with the help of intelligent people in our life we can overcome any problems. The importance of being active in life, the goals that can be achieved through courage and determination, our outlook and perception of things and a lot of other emotions and values are discussed via engaging, interesting stories of different characters. The characters are so lively and imaginable that one starts connecting with them. There are stories about shopkeepers, mouse, kings, Gods, sculptors and other people.

The author Sudha Murthy has no doubt done a wonderful job of highlighting the importance of family bondings. In between the storytelling sessions, the family chores are very well inserted by the author. The concept of the grandmother telling a story a day is really nice as it keeps the stories length at a pace enough for young readers to carry on with their reading habit.

This book is truly one of the finest books of short stories. The language used in the book is simple and easy to understand with the inclusion of new words for kids to learn. I would recommend this to be a part of your kid’s books library. Do grab your edition here and enjoy reading it with your kids.</p>

            <h1>Race 3 is a mere show-reel for Salman Khan fans. Poorly directed, with a ridiculous plot and sub-par acting, this is a new low for the superstar.
                Rating: 1/5.During one of the many forced fist fights in Race 3, Salman Khan is getting the better of his opponents when he is hit by a rod. He smirks, turns towards the camera and punches the enemy in face as if he is punishing the man for not recognising the Bhai of Bollywood. The camera doesn’t cut to the rod, which, I am sure, is broken in half by now. Such is Salman’s unparalleled rage and such is the vision of director Remo D’Souza.
            Race 3 is everything film students are taught not to do, but then what do they know? From the first scene in which Anil Kapoor blows up a gang member with the help of a pen bomb to Salman coming to the rescue of his family in a base-jump suit, Race 3 unabashedly targets the fans. There isn’t any pretension of logical filmmaking or sound screenplay. It seems Race 3 categorically wants the non-Salman fans to mind their own business.</h1>
